Tools for analyzing multivariate acoustic-phonetic distributions across
different talkers and groups of talkers.  This is a companion package to the
paper ["Structure in talker variability: How much is there and how much can it
help?"](https://osf.io/ycfzu/).

Written and maintained by Dave Kleinschmidt, inspired by earlier code by Kodi
Weatherholtz and Florian Jaeger.
